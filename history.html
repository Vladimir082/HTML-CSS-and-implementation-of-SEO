					<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                     The history of the tent and camping can be divided into three main parts with each part signifying a different aspect of the tent:    </h4><br>
					<h5>	-Early history : Pre 16th century </h5>
					<h5>	-Modern history : The 16th to 20 th century</h5>
					<h5>	-Recent history : The 21th century to the modern day</h5>
					
					<br><br>
					<h4><u> Early history of the tent: Pre 16th century</u>
				</h4>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tent foundations and camping holiday dates back to the Iron Age. 
					Archaeological digs discovered artefacts around the world and can be viewed in the north-west museum. 
					<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, there is not much evidence from this era. 
					The first written evidence of the tent and camping comes from the Romans in AD 203. 
					The Romans ancient scribers describe a tent as a light shelter for a people,it a some way of social lifestyle and it is ideal for camping holiday
					or family holiday in the terms of low cost holiday.However, noones offer renting services in this time. After this period, there is not any evidence until the 16 th century.  </p><br>

					<h4><u> Modern history of the tent: The 16th to 20 th century</u></h4>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 1598, king Charles give the tent the status of a accommodation which helped the poor people settle down,especially for the families. This period is known as the golden period because the popularity of the tent grew very quickly. 
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, during this time there were many wars in the country between the king and his enemies. The country saw war for almost 120 years, and it brought a lot of disasters such as the plague in 1726. This disaster killed almost sixty percentage of the tent's population, which was significant strain on the population and further development of tent accommodation. The golden age had ended.
 In 1756, king George visited the tent town during his travels around the country and he decided to take away the status of accommodation because he didn’t feel that the tent was a accommodation but was instead a shelter.There were no more significant tent developments in in the country after these difficult times until 1843. 
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1843, there was a steam railway connection built between around  which offer a new opportunity to travvel with a tent. During development of the railways the population of backpakers with tent increased in whole country again. </p>

					<h4><u> Recent history of the tent: The 21th century to the modern day</u>
				</h4>
				
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The First World Wars effect tent life style across the country. Men were conscripted to fight in the war and live in the tent which was very unconfortable.Rent services was provide mostly with army organisations.  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the Second World War did not affect tent life style as much as the First World War. 
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After these wars, things were good for the tent development – prosperity and peace time have been enjoyed up to the present day. Nowadays the tent life style focus more on the tourist industry then in the past in order to sustain our  economy. Our country community sees the strong potential in the tourist industry .
